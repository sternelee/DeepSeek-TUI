# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.9] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- DeepSeek thinking-mode tool-call rounds now always replay `reasoning_content` in all subsequent requests (including across new user turns), matching DeepSeek's documented API contract that assistant messages with tool calls must retain their reasoning content forever.
- Missing `reasoning_content` on a tool-call assistant message now substitutes a safe placeholder (`"(reasoning omitted)"`) instead of dropping the tool calls and their matching tool results, preventing orphaned conversation chains and API 400 errors.
- Session checkpoint now persists a Thinking-block placeholder for tool-call turns that produced no streamed reasoning text, keeping on-disk sessions structurally correct so subsequent requests avoid HTTP 400 rejections.
- Token estimation for compaction now counts thinking tokens across all tool-call rounds (not just the current user turn), aligning with the updated reasoning_content replay rule.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- DeepSeek V4 Pro cost estimates now use DeepSeek's current limited-time 75% discount until 2026-05-05 15:59 UTC, then automatically fall back to the base Pro rates.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- Alternate-screen TUI sessions now capture mouse input by default so wheel scrolling moves the transcript instead of exposing terminal scrollback from before the TUI started. Use `--no-mouse-capture` or `tui.mouse_capture = false` when terminal-native drag selection is preferred.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- DeepSeek V4 thinking-mode tool turns now checkpoint the engine's authoritative API transcript, including assistant `reasoning_content` on reasoning-to-tool-call turns with no visible assistant text.
- Chat Completions request building now drops stale V4 tool-call rounds that are missing required `reasoning_content`, preventing old corrupted checkpoints from triggering DeepSeek HTTP 400 replay errors.
- Web search now falls back to Bing HTML results when DuckDuckGo returns a bot challenge or otherwise yields no parseable results.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- DeepSeek V4 tool-result context now preserves large file reads and command outputs instead of compacting noisy tools to a 900-character snippet after 2k characters.
- Capacity guardrail refresh no longer performs destructive summary compaction unless the normal model-aware compaction thresholds are actually crossed.
- V4 compaction summaries retain larger tool-result excerpts and summary input when compaction is genuinely needed.
- The transcript now follows the bottom again when sending a new message, shows an in-app scrollbar when internally scrolled, and leaves mouse capture off in `--no-alt-screen` mode so terminal-native scrolling can work.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **DeepSeek V4 support**: `deepseek-v4-pro` (flagship) and `deepseek-v4-flash` (fast/cheap) are now first-class model IDs with 1M context windows.
- **Reasoning-effort tier**: new `reasoning_effort` config field (`off | low | medium | high | max`) mapped to DeepSeek's `reasoning_effort` + `thinking` request fields. Defaults to `max`.
- **Shift+Tab cycles reasoning-effort** through the three behaviorally distinct tiers (`off → high → max`). The current tier is shown as a ⚡ chip in the header.
- Per-model pricing table: `deepseek-v4-pro` priced at $0.145/$1.74/$3.48 per 1M tokens (cache-hit/miss/output); `deepseek-v4-flash` and legacy aliases at $0.028/$0.14/$0.28.

### Changed
- **Default model flipped to `deepseek-v4-pro`** (from `deepseek-reasoner`).
- `deepseek-chat` / `deepseek-reasoner` remain as silent aliases of `deepseek-v4-flash` for API compatibility; priced identically.
- **Context compaction**: 1M-context V4 models now compact at 800k input tokens or 2,000 messages, so short/tool-heavy sessions do not compact as if they were 128k-context runs.
- Cycling modes is now Tab-only; Shift+Tab is repurposed for reasoning-effort (reverse-mode cycle was low-value with only three modes).
- Updated help/hint strings, validator error messages, and the model picker to reference V4 IDs.

### Fixed
- `requires_reasoning_content` now recognizes `deepseek-v4*` so thinking streams render correctly on V4 models.
- DeepSeek V4 thinking-mode tool calls now preserve prior assistant `reasoning_content` whenever a tool call is replayed, matching DeepSeek's multi-turn contract and avoiding HTTP 400 rejections on later turns.
- Raw Chat Completions requests now send DeepSeek's top-level `thinking` parameter instead of the OpenAI SDK-only `extra_body` wrapper.
- Config, env, and UI model selection now normalize legacy DeepSeek aliases to `deepseek-v4-flash` instead of preserving old model labels.
- npm wrapper first-run downloads now use process-unique temp files so concurrent `deepseek` / `deepseek-tui` invocations do not race on `*.download` files.

## [0.3.33] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- Footer polish: simplified footer rendering, removed footer clock label, updated status line layout
- Palette cleanup: removed `FOOTER_HINT` color constant

### Removed
- `FOOTER_HINT` color constant from palette (use `TEXT_MUTED` or `TEXT_HINT` instead)

### Fixed
- Test updates to align with simplified footer logic
- Empty state placeholder text removed for cleaner UI

## [0.3.32] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Finance tool: Yahoo Finance v8 quote endpoint with chart fallback, supporting stocks, ETFs, indices, forex, and crypto lookups.
- Header widget redesign: proportional truncation, context-usage bar with gradient fill, streaming indicator, and graceful narrow-terminal degradation.
- Expanded test coverage: 680+ tests including footer state, context spans, plan prompt lifecycle, workspace context refresh, header rendering, and finance tool integration tests with wiremock.
- Workspace context refresh with configurable TTL and deferred initial fetch.
- Config command additions for runtime settings management.

### Changed
- Redesigned footer status strip with mode/model/status layout, context bar, and narrow-terminal fallback.
- Plan prompt now uses numeric selection (1-4) instead of keyword input; old aliases are sent as regular messages.
- Archived outdated docs (`workspace_migration_status.md` -> `docs/archive/`).
- Trimmed AGENTS.md boilerplate and updated task counts.
- Clarified release-surface documentation: crates.io publication may lag the workspace/npm wrapper.

### Fixed
- Header `metadata_spans` now uses `saturating_sub` to prevent underflow on narrow terminals.
- Finance tool reuses a single HTTP client instead of rebuilding per request.
- Finance tool tests no longer leak temp directories.

## [0.3.31] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Replaced the finance tool backend with Yahoo Finance v8 + CoinGecko fallback for reliable real-time market data (stocks, ETFs, indices, forex, crypto).
- Added compaction UX: status strip shows animated COMPACTING indicator during context summarization, footer reflects compaction state, and CompactionCompleted events now include message count statistics.
- Added send flash: brief tinted background highlight on the last user message after sending.
- Added braille typing indicator with smooth 10-frame animation cycle.

### Changed
- Redesigned the footer status strip with mode/model/token/cost layout, quadrant separators, and a context-usage bar.
- Added Unicode prefix indicators (▸ You, ◆ Answer, ● System) to chat history cells for visual distinction.
- Improved thinking token delineation with labeled delimiters in transcript rendering.
- Refactored source code into workspace crates for better modularity and dependency management.

### Fixed
- Fixed Plan mode ESC key dismissing the prompt without clearing `plan_prompt_pending`, which prevented the prompt from reappearing on subsequent plan completions.
- Fixed clippy lint (collapsible_if) in web browsing session management.

## [0.3.30] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Added a release-ready local npm smoke path that builds binaries, serves release assets locally, packs the wrapper, installs the tarball, and checks both entrypoints before publish.
- Added an opt-in full-matrix local release-asset fixture so `npm run release:check` can be exercised before GitHub release assets exist.

### Changed
- Bumped the Rust workspace crates and npm wrapper to `0.3.30`.
- Pointed the npm wrapper's default `deepseekBinaryVersion` at `0.3.30` for the next coordinated Rust + npm release.
- Updated the crates dry-run helper to work from a dirty workspace and to preflight dependent workspace crates without requiring unpublished versions to already exist on crates.io.

## [0.3.29] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Added npm publish-time release asset verification for the `deepseek-tui` package to fail fast when expected GitHub binaries are missing.
- Added checksum manifests to GitHub release assets and checksum verification in the npm installer.
- Added `npm pack` install-and-smoke CI coverage for the `deepseek-tui` wrapper package.
- Added an end-to-end release runbook covering crates.io, GitHub Releases, and npm publication.

### Changed
- Updated npm package documentation for clearer install modes, environment overrides, and release integrity behavior.
- Improved installer support-matrix error messaging for unsupported platform/architecture combinations.
- Decoupled npm package version from default binary artifact version via `deepseekBinaryVersion`, enabling packaging-only npm releases.
- Moved the `deepseek-tui` binary target inside `crates/tui` so `cargo publish --dry-run -p deepseek-tui` works from the workspace package layout.
- Replaced the root-level crates publish workflow with an ordered workspace publish flow.
- Reworked first-run onboarding and README copy around primary workflows instead of shortcut memorization.
- Relaxed onboarding API-key format heuristics so unusual keys warn instead of blocking setup.

## [0.3.28] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- Converted the project to a modular Cargo workspace using a `crates/` layout.
- Added new crate boundaries mirroring a deepseek architecture (`agent`, `config`, `core`, `execpolicy`, `hooks`, `mcp`, `protocol`, `state`, `tools`, `tui-core`, `tui`, and `app-server`).

### Changed
- Added parity CI coverage with protocol/state/snapshot checks.
- Updated release workflow to build both `deepseek` and `deepseek-tui` binaries.

## [0.3.26] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Resolved SSE stream corruption caused by byte/string position mismatch in streaming parse flow.
- Hardened base URL validation to reject non-HTTP/HTTPS schemes.
- Prevented multi-byte UTF-8 truncation panics in common-prefix and runtime thread summary paths.
- Corrected context usage alert thresholds by separating warning and critical trigger levels.

### Changed
- Removed non-code utility tools from the runtime tool registry (`calculator`, `weather`, `sports`, `finance`, `time`) and related wiring.
- Consolidated duplicate URL encoding helpers by delegating to shared `crate::utils::url_encode`.
- Replaced broad crate-level lint suppressions with targeted `#[allow(...)]` annotations where justified.
- Cleaned up dead APIs, unused struct fields, unused builder helpers, and non-integrated modules.
- Addressed clippy findings across the codebase (collapsible conditionals, defaults, indexing helpers, and API signature cleanup).

## [0.3.24] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Preserve reasoning-only assistant turns for DeepSeek reasoning models (`deepseek-reasoner`, R-series markers) when rebuilding chat history.
- Align SSE tool streaming indices so each tool block start/delta/stop uses the same block index.
- Prevent transcript auto-scroll-to-bottom when a non-empty transcript selection is active.
- Allow session picker search mode to accept the current selection with a single `Enter` press.
- Preserve tool output whitespace/indentation while still wrapping long unbroken tokens.
- Make transcript selection copy/highlighting display-width aware (wide chars and tabs).
- Gate execpolicy behavior on the `exec_policy` feature flag across CLI/tool execution paths.
- Run doctor API connectivity checks using the effective loaded config/profile (instead of reloading defaults).
- Parse DeepSeek model context-window suffix hints such as `-32k` and `-256k`.
- Update README config docs with key environment overrides and a direct link to full configuration docs.

## [0.3.23] - 2026-02-24

### Changed
- Updated project copy to describe the app as a terminal-native TUI/CLI for DeepSeek models (not pinned to a specific model generation).

### Fixed
- Model selection and config validation now accept any valid `deepseek-*` model ID (including future releases), while still normalizing common aliases like `deepseek-v3.2` and `deepseek-r1`.
- Tool-call recovery now auto-loads deferred tools when the model requests them directly, instead of failing with manual `tool_search_*` instructions.
- YOLO mode now preloads tools by default (including deferred MCP tools), so model tool calls can run immediately without discovery indirection.
- Unknown tool-call failures now include discovery guidance and nearest tool-name suggestions instead of generic availability errors.
- Slash-command errors now suggest the closest known command (for example `/modle` -> `/model`) instead of only returning a generic unknown-command message.

## [0.3.22] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- Interactive `/config` editing modal for runtime settings updates.

### Changed
- Retired user-facing `/set` command path (no longer reachable/discoverable).

- When `DEEPSEEK_CONFIG_PATH` points to a missing file, config loading now falls back to `~/.deepseek/config.toml` if it exists.

### Changed
- Removed committed transient runtime artifacts (`session_*.json`, `.deepseek/trusted`) and added ignore rules to prevent re-commit.

## [0.3.16] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- `deepseek models` CLI command to fetch and list models from the configured `/v1/models` endpoint (with `--json` output mode).
- `/models` slash command to fetch and display live model IDs in the TUI.

- Runtime HTTP/SSE API (`deepseek serve --http`) with durable thread/turn/item lifecycle, interrupt/steer, and replayable event timeline.
- Background task queue (`/task add|list|show|cancel` and `POST /v1/tasks`) with persistent storage, bounded worker pool, and timeline/artifact tracking.

### Changed
- Centralized the default text model (`DEFAULT_TEXT_MODEL`) and shared common model list to reduce drift across runtime/config paths.
- `/model` now clarifies that any valid DeepSeek model ID is accepted (including future releases), while still showing common model IDs.

### Fixed
- Expanded reasoning-model detection for chat history reconstruction (supports R-series and reasoner-style naming without hardcoding single versions).
- Aligned docs/config examples with the then-current runtime default model.

## [0.3.14] - 2026-02-05

### Added
